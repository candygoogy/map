// The 404's scroll reveals, as the experiments copied them (experiments/shared/notfound-reveal.ts)
// from candygoogy.dev's scripts/reveal.ts,
// with only what the 404 has: .rv and .rv-mask (no hairlines, statements,
// band, images or intro curtain). On the platform: IntersectionObserver
// (inView) and Web Animations (el.animate). Each plays once as it scrolls
// into view and is marked .is-in. Siblings that arrive together rise in
// turn, in reading order.
//
//   .rv          rises 40px (32px on phones) and fades in; headings and
//                large text also come into focus (a short blur)
//   .rv-mask     its child rises out of the clip, settling from a slight
//                skew
//   data-i       order within a group (when the whole group arrives at once)
//   data-d       extra delay for a whole group, in ms (as --d, notfound.css),
//                counted from the earliest group that arrives with it
//
// Each element arrives as its own top crosses its line (see line, below).
// A group delay counts from the earliest one in the batch, so blocks
// arriving together keep their order and a lone late arrival starts at
// once. Once scrolling has stopped for 500ms, whatever is still waiting in
// the window arrives anyway, and whatever a fast scroll carried past,
// above the window, is marked as arrived unplayed (it never rises from
// below on the way back up).
//
// Content never depends on this script. Hidden start states apply only
// under html.motion-ready, which is set after everything already on screen
// has been marked as arrived (so nothing that was seen disappears). If the
// script never runs, nothing is hidden. With reduced motion nothing is
// hidden either, and elements are only marked .is-in.
